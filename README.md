### World library info map

These statistics include data, if available, for the total number of libraries, librarians, volumes, expenditures, and users for every country and territory in the world.  

Data from [oclc.org](https://www.oclc.org/en/global-library-statistics.html)  

*note: The data is in some cases quite old and in some others collected from unreliable sources.  
You can read more about that in the oclc website.
